# R-Mountain-Climbing-Algorithm-Based-on-Gradient-Descent-Algorithm
In this R simulation I tried to find the highest point of the mountain. I took a csv file which simulates the topography of a mountain. Each points in the csv file represents the height of the mountain. Firstly, I used a gradient descent algorithm to find the coefficients of the estimation of the hyperplane. This hyperplane is created by a linear regression model. Because of the linear regression, there are some points which intersect with the original plane. This means that some points of the original plane is above the hyperplane. I created another linear regression model (with the points which are above the hyperplane) by gradient descent algorithm. My aim was excluding some points which are not the highest point of the mountain. In the second iteration, I excluded nearly most of the points which are not the highest point of the mountain. After that I reached the point which is 170 (Highest point is 189). This means that my algorithm works correctly. After each iteration I can reach a higher point in the csv file. Since my program needs so much time, I can only be able to do 2 iterations.
